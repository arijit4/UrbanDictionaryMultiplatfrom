# Urban Dictionary

This is an app which I made for trying out the new tech in the town, `Compose Multiplatform`.

This project is not so well structured and optimised as I just made this project to get my hands on to
the compose multiplatform and I am still learning. As the internet owes most of this project, I am making this project
open sourced.

I don't plan to regularly maintain this project but issues and contributions are always welcome.
I will try to address them as soon as I get time.

### How to use this app?

<!--- `Step 1` - download your platform specific app<br> -->
<!--- `Step 2` - Install the app  -->
<!--- `Step 2` - Use just the way you used the webapp  -->

- `Step 1` - Clone this git repo
- `Step 2` - Build with [__fleet__](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)
- `Step 3` - use just the way you use the website

> [!NOTE]
> I will add built apps soon to download...
<br>

Additional features:

- `Quick-search Panel` - you can click a highlighted phrase and a side-panel
  will open up with the results for that phrase without opening a new tab or so
- Fluid search experience
